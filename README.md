## ✨ Features at a Glance

### 🟢 Direct-to-Consumer Model
- **No Middlemen:** Directly connects Maryala's local growers with end-consumers.
- **Farmer Spotlights:** Interactive bios showcasing stories, locations, and cultivation methods of our farmers (**M. Surendhar Reddy**, **N. Bhaskar Reddy**, and **P. Raju**).
- **Transparency:** Complete tracing from the soil to the kitchen table.

### 🔥 Firebase Real-Time Backend Integration
- **Live Database Syncing:** Built using Firebase Cloud Firestore, featuring active queries with real-time snapshot listeners (`onSnapshot`). Product changes, pricing edits, and stock toggles made in the admin panel propagate instantly to active client pages.
- **Failover Mock Database:** Integrates a robust offline fallback mode. If Firebase keys are unconfigured or connections fail, the app gracefully redirects operations to local browser `localStorage` for catalogs and session management, guaranteeing zero downtime.
- **Automatic Catalog Seeding:** On the very first launch, if the Firestore `products` collection is empty, a cloud batch write automatically seeds the database with 9 premium default agricultural catalog documents.

### 🛡️ Secure Admin Dashboard Portal

## 🚀 Getting Started & Local Development

This is a pure frontend static project with cloud database attachments. It requires no installation, compilers, or build systems to run.

### Method 1: Lightweight Local Server (Recommended)
To fully enjoy all custom features (like localized media files, video streaming, and robust storage access), run the project through a local development server:

*Using Python:*
```bash
# In the project directory, run:
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.

*Using Node.js (`live-server`):*
```bash
npx live-server
```

### Method 2: Accessing the Admin Portal
1. Run your local server.
2. In your browser address bar, append `#admin` to the URL: [http://localhost:8000/#admin](http://localhost:8000/#admin).
3. The custom **Admin Portal** login modal will open on top of the blurred landing page.
4. If Firebase configuration keys are active, enter your authorized Firestore user credentials.
5. If running in the **Local Fallback Database** mode (when Firebase placeholders are unchanged), enter the sandbox credentials:
   - **Username:** `admin@kshetrivafarms.com`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
6. Click **Login to Dashboard** to enter the live dashboard console.

---

## 📐 How the Firebase Real-Time Synchronization Works

When the application boots, `script.js` checks the Firebase Configuration keys. If placeholders are replaced, it initializes the Firebase SDK:

```javascript
if (typeof firebase !== 'undefined' && firebaseConfig.apiKey !== "YOUR_API_KEY") {
    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    db = firebase.firestore();
    auth = firebase.auth();
    useFirebase = true;
}
```

### 1. Active Listening
If connected successfully, the client registers a real-time Firestore database snapshot listener. Whenever an administrator changes any data, the client grid updates dynamically:

```javascript
db.collection("products").orderBy("id", "asc").onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
    let dbProducts = [];
    snapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        dbProducts.push({ docId: doc.id, ...doc.data() });
    });
    products = dbProducts;
    renderProducts();
    updateCartUI();
});
```

### 2. Auto-Seeding
If the Cloud database collection returns empty, the app compiles the collection using a fast batch execution to populate the initial mock catalog from code structures:

```javascript
const batch = db.batch();
const collectionRef = db.collection("products");
defaultCatalog.forEach((item) => {
    const docRef = collectionRef.doc(`prod_${item.id}`);
    batch.set(docRef, item);
});
batch.commit();
```

---

## ⚙️ How the WhatsApp Ordering Works

When the user clicks the **Send Order on WhatsApp** button in the shopping drawer, `script.js` processes the cart object and compiles the receipt.

The invoice is dynamically constructed in JS (supporting bilingual messages):
```javascript
let message = isTe ? `*కొత్త ఆర్డర్ - క్షేత్రీవ ఫార్మ్స్*\n` : `*New Order - Kshetriva Farms*\n`;
message += `===============================\n`;
// Loop through items in cart ...
message += `${index + 1}. *${product.name}* - ${qty} ${product.unit} (₹${itemTotal})\n`;
message += `===============================\n`;
message += `*Total Amount:* ₹${totalSum}\n\n`;
```

It is then fully encoded using `encodeURIComponent(message)` and bound to the URL:
`https://wa.me/918374276995?text={encoded_message}`

---

## 📐 Responsive Breakpoints

The custom stylesheet features premium responsiveness defined for standard viewports:
- **Desktops (`>= 1024px`):** Full grid layouts, multi-column about & farmer profiles, full desktop nav with sliding toggle switches.
- **Tablets & iPads (`768px - 1023px`):** Scaled typography, responsive grid columns (2-column layouts for farmer cards), accessible navigation.
- **Smartphones (`<= 767px`):** 1-column layouts, hamburger slide-out menu drawer, and visual floating buttons on screen corners for instant WhatsApp and basket access.

  - Corrected the second farmer's identity from *E. Bhaskar Reddy* to **`N. Bhaskar Reddy`**.
- **Bilingual Consistency:**
  - Updated all associated keys inside the language translation dictionary in `script.js` for both **English** (`M. Surendhar Reddy` / `N. Bhaskar Reddy`) and **Telugu** (`ఎమ్. సురేందర్ రెడ్డి` / `ఎన్. భాస్కర్ రెడ్డి`). This ensures translation parity when users toggle language preferences.

#### 2. 📸 High-Quality Portrait Crop & Integration
- **Asset Sourcing:**
  - Replaced the placeholder image (`farmer_ramesh.webp`) with a new, high-quality, professional portrait provided by the team.
- **Image Standardization Process:**
  - Standardized the new portrait to a clean **1:1 square crop** (at `1000 x 1000 px`) to eliminate borders and preserve composition.
  - Resized using the Lanczos interpolation filter to exactly **`1024 x 1024 px`** to match the grid styling of all other farmer profiles.
  - Saved as a compressed **WebP** asset (`images/farmer_surendhar.webp`) for quick loading and responsive rendering.
- **HTML Binding:**
  - Wired `index.html`'s card component to render the updated image asset.

#### 3. 🖥️ Local Verification Server

#### 1. 🔍 Comprehensive SEO & Social Previews
- **Verification & Analytics hooks**: Injected custom placeholder hooks for Google Search Console and Google Analytics (`gtag.js`) inside `<head>`.
- **Search Rankings & Canonicalization**: Standardized canonical URL links to prevent content duplicate penalties across search engines. Added robust keyword arrays.
- **Social Media Previews**: Integrated rich Open Graph and Twitter Card tags to display premium visual preview cards when links are shared on WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter.

#### 2. 🗺️ Search Crawler Metadata
- **robots.txt**: Deployed crawler directives to permit complete storefront crawling while strictly blocking indexing on the administrative hash route `/#admin`. Linked the sitemap registry.

- **CLS Shift Prevention**: Injected explicit native width and height aspect-ratio dimensions on all static images (`index.html`) and dynamic product listings (`script.js`), resulting in zero Cumulative Layout Shifts during asset loading.
- **Preconnect Handshakes**: Established preconnect link attributes targeting external font, icon, and analytics hostnames to resolve TCP and SSL connection handshakes early, saving up to 200ms on first render.
- **Below-the-fold Lazy Loading**: Set up native `loading="lazy"` tags on all images below-the-fold, reducing initial bandwidth payload sizes and accelerating speed indexes.

#### 5. 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) Installability & Offline Caching
- **manifest.json**: Configured the standard web manifest with short names, theme colors (`#2e7d32`), and full orientation presets. Standardized the launch icons mapping standard scopes (`"purpose": "any"`) and adaptive Android icons (`"purpose": "maskable"`).
- **sw.js**: Built a robust pre-cache Service Worker caching static structures (HTML, CSS, JS, and high-res WebP images), yielding instant 0ms loads and complete offline fallback support.
- **High-Resolution Icon Pipelines (Android Fix)**: Converted the master square logo `images/logo.webp` (2048x2048) into Lanczos-filtered high-resolution assets **`images/logo_pwa_192.png`** and **`images/logo_pwa_512.png`** to resolve a subtle gotcha where Android fell back to browser default shortcuts due to the physical `32x32` size of favicon.png.
- **Retina iOS Integration (iOS Safari Fix)**: Re-wired the `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` tag inside `index.html` to point to the high-resolution `images/logo_pwa_192.png` instead of the small favicon, guaranteeing crisp Retina displays for iOS Home Screen app launcher additions.

#### 2. ⏳ Day:Hour:Minutes Countdown Timer
- **High-Fidelity Timer Engine**: Refactored the storefront countdown calculations to parse remaining time into `{ days, hours, mins }`.
- **Responsive Suffix Display**: Renders the timer as `Xd Yh Zm` for a modern and space-saving aesthetic, dynamically shifting to `Yh Zm` once under the 24-hour mark.

#### 3. 🛒 Updated Smart Minimum Order Rules (Hybrid Checks)
- **Smart Validation Rules**: Re-aligned cart validations to approve orders if they contain **at least 3 unique products** OR if the final cart value **exceeds ₹99** (amount > 99).
- **Double-Lock Guards**: Integrated the validation both on the UI cart drawer and programmatically within the checkout action, blocking checkout and rendering custom helper prompts for incomplete orders.
- **Bilingual Alerts**: Fully localized the warnings for English (`"Minimum order: 3 products or total above ₹99 to checkout."`) and Telugu (`"కనీస ఆర్డర్: 3 ఉత్పత్తులు లేదా మొత్తం ₹99 కంటే ఎక్కువ ఉండాలి."`).

#### 4. ⚙️ Diagnostic Compilation & Cache Invalidation
- **Syntax Diagnostics**: Verified JavaScript code compilation integrity using Node compiler diagnostics (`node -c`), resolving critical duplicate variable declarations.
- **Service Worker Cache-Busting**: Bumped the Service Worker cache version key to `kshetriva-farms-cache-v5` in `sw.js` and updated the script reference standard query parameter to `script.js?v=3.2` inside `index.html`.

- **Smart Validations**: Isolated minimum order validations to run based on the products' discounted subtotal before delivery charges are added.

#### 3. 🌿 Linear Leafy Product Multipliers
- **Options Refactoring**: Reconfigured `QTY_TEMPLATES.leafy` to employ linear multipliers (2 Katta = 2x base price, 4 Katta = 4x base price, 8 Katta = 8x base price) to disable dynamic volume discounts on bundles.

#### 4. 👨‍🌾 Farmer Spotlights & Asset Sync
- **Bhaskar's Image Optimization**: Replaced `farmer_bhaskar.png` with the high-resolution portrait `farmer_bhaskar.jpg` under `images/`, and added `object-position: center 15%` style in `index.html` to perfectly focus and zoom-out the subject in the farmer grid.
- **Remote Asset Merging**: Fetched and merged remote commits, successfully retrieving missing leafy crop images (`Thota_kura.webp`, `gongura.webp`, `green_chilli.webp`) from the repository.

### 🗓️ June 12, 2026

#### 1. ⏱️ Ordering Window Adjustment (Friday 12:00 PM Open)
- **Schedule Re-Alignment**: Configured the storefront ordering schedule open-window bounds in `script.js` to open on **Friday at 12:00 PM (Noon)** (openHour: 12) instead of 1:00 PM.
- **Bilingual Banners and Binders**: Updated static closed-window elements in `index.html` and dynamic translation templates in `script.js` (for English and Telugu) to notify buyers that ordering opens at Friday 12 PM.

#### 2. 📝 Integrated Tabbed Multi-Blog Architecture (`blog.html`)
- **Single-Page Unified Blog**: Combined both "Why Farm-Fresh Vegetables Last Longer" and "How Much Pesticide Usage Is Safe in Vegetables?" articles into `blog.html`.
- **Premium Tab Interface**: Introduced two large, responsive selection buttons matching Outfit/Inter typography that dynamically toggle active article visibility.
- **Dynamic Routing and State Synchronization**: Refactored `blog.js` to parse URL hashes (`#freshness` vs `#pesticides`), automatically toggling visibility, updating hero banner text/metadata, and updating document titles smoothly.
- **Routing Redirect Fallback**: Replaced `blog-pesticides.html` with a meta-refresh redirect routing traffic to `blog.html#pesticides` to prevent dead links.

#### 3. 📸 Premium Asset Refinements
- **Wooden Crate Imagery**: Extracted two distinct high-fidelity crops from a user-uploaded mockup:
  - Crate on the doorstep saved as `images/blog_delivery_box.png` (displays under pesticide safety consumer effects).
  - Crate on the truck saved as `images/delivery_box.webp` (displays in the main landing page Farm Gallery "Ready for Delivery").

#### 5. 🛒 Default Selected Quantity (500g Default for Regular Items)
- **Default Dropdown Selection**: Refactored `script.js` to select the `500g` weight option by default for regular vegetables (if the option is available), falling back to the first available option for other product types.
- **Cache-Busting & PWA Cache**: Bumped script version parameter inside `index.html` to `v=3.5` and incremented Service Worker cache name to `kshetriva-farms-cache-v16` in `sw.js` to force immediate update.

### 🗓️ June 13, 2026

#### 1. ⏱️ Ordering Window Adjustment (Saturday 9:00 PM Close)
- **Schedule Re-Alignment**: Configured the storefront ordering schedule close-window bounds in `script.js` to close on **Saturday at 9:00 PM** (closeHour: 21) instead of 1:00 PM.
- **Bilingual Banners and Binders**: Updated static elements in `index.html` and dynamic translation templates in `script.js` (for English and Telugu) to notify buyers that ordering closes at Saturday 9 PM.
- **Service Worker Cache-Busting**: Bumped script version parameter inside `index.html` to `v=3.7` and incremented Service Worker cache name to `kshetriva-farms-cache-v17` in `sw.js` to force immediate update on client devices.

#### 2. 🎟️ Coupon Code 'Delivery30' Implementation
- **Delivery Discount Engine**: Added a bilingual coupon code system checking for code `Delivery30` inside the shopping basket footer.
- **Dynamic Cost Sync**: Successful coupon application drops standard delivery charges from ₹49 to ₹30, dynamically adjusting checkout totals, totals breakdown labels, and WhatsApp formatted checkout invoices seamlessly.

### 🗓️ June 19, 2026

#### 1. 💬 WhatsApp Leads Capture Modal & secure Admin Dashboard visualizer (Version 3.5)
- **WhatsApp Clicks Interception**: Added javascript hooks to intercept user click events on `#whatsappOrderBtn`, `.hero-btns .btn-whatsapp`, and `.whatsapp-float` buttons.
- **Contact Details Modal**: Deployed an overlay form modal (`#whatsappDetailsModal`) prompting for Name, WhatsApp Phone, and Area/Locality in English and Telugu.
- **Leads Storage Platform**: Developed database handlers to save submitted details to either Firestore collection `leads` (when online) or fallback `localStorage` key `kshetriva_leads`. Limited entries to the **latest 100 details** using automated query batch deletion (for Firestore) and slice routines (for LocalStorage).
- **Auto-Fill Caching**: Saves submitted details under browser cache `kshetriva_customer_info` to pre-populate inputs on subsequent contacts.
- **Pre-pended Details Receipt**: Prepends Name, Phone, and Area to WhatsApp order receipts and chat templates dynamically.
- **Admin Leads Visualization**: Integrated a new tabbed workspace in the `#admin` Dashboard with a complete leads directory table, direct dial/chat links, and deletion triggers.
- **Service Worker Cache-Busting**: Bumped script version parameter inside `index.html` to `v=3.8` and incremented Service Worker cache name to `kshetriva-farms-cache-v18` in `sw.js` to clear client caches immediately.

#### 2. 🔐 Firestore Syncing & Connection Diagnosis Fix (Version 3.5.1)
- **Optimal Firestore Security Rules**: Created [firestore.rules](file:///d:/Kshetriva_farms/Farms_Version_3.5/firestore.rules) to permit unauthenticated write access (`create` only) to the `leads` collection. This allows customers on all devices to successfully write leads to the shared Firestore DB instead of falling back to device-specific `localStorage`.
- **Dynamic Database Sync Status**: Integrated a connection status indicator badge (`#adminSyncBadge`) in the Admin Dashboard header (modified [index.html](file:///d:/Kshetriva_farms/Farms_Version_3.5/index.html) and [script.js](file:///d:/Kshetriva_farms/Farms_Version_3.5/script.js)). Displays real-time database connection statuses (`Live Connected`, `Database Error (Check Rules)`, or `Offline Mode (Local Only)`) to simplify database connectivity troubleshooting.

### 🗓️ June 20, 2026

#### 1. 💬 Safari WhatsApp Redirection Fix (Version 3.5.2)
- **Safari Popup Blocker Bypass**: Resolved an issue where the WhatsApp checkout and chat redirects were blocked by Safari's strict popup blocker. Changed the lead submission event flow to write customer data to the Firestore/Local database asynchronously in the background while opening the WhatsApp window/tab (`window.open`) synchronously in the primary user gesture thread.

### 🗓️ June 25, 2026

#### 1. 📊 Company Statistics & Financial Reconciliation (Version 4.0)
- **Financial Reporting**: Added a secure Company Statistics tab to the Admin Dashboard listing week-by-week total sales, total actual crop expenses, and net profit calculations.
- **Temporal Week boundaries**: Cost price updates apply strictly to the present/future weeks. Historical weeks' cost metrics are frozen upon closing to prevent retrospective alteration of financial records.
- **Inline Cost Save**: Replaced disruptive JS alerts with inline checkmark state changes (`"Saved ✓"` for 1.5 seconds) on product cost settings.

#### 2. 📦 Quantity Scaling & Packing Logistics (Version 4.0)
- **Unit Multipliers**: Added weight/piece/bundle scaling calculations (`getOptionMultiplier`) to resolve product quantity mismatches (such as legacy options and `500g * 2 = 1kg` instead of `2kg`).
- **Ordered Products in Quantity**: Replaced the legacy demand leaderboard with a detailed packing dashboard showing aggregated weights and variant counts (e.g. `2 Katta × 5`, `500g × 2`).
- **Logistics Clean-up**: Removed "Delivery Status" select options, delivery columns, and farmer ownership mappings from the Logistics Table and order catalog modal to satisfy security and privacy constraints.

#### 3. 🔒 Week-Locking, Data Clearing, & Administration Enhancements (Version 4.1)
- **Completed Week-Locking**: Implemented dynamic week status detection (`Present`, `Incomplete`, `Locked`). A previous week is locked if all its orders are marked as `'delivered'`. Deleting leads/orders or clearing directories for locked weeks is blocked.
- **Granular Week-Specific Clearing**: Replaced the global "Empty Order Book" button with a "Clear Current Week" function. Added a week-wise "Clear" trigger under Company Statistics (disabled for completed locked weeks).
- **Custom Order Date & Delivery Fees**: Added date-time and delivery charge override input fields in the Create/Edit Manual Order modal to allow retroactively placing or correcting orders.
- **Scoping Leaderboard**: Scoped the Founder packing breakdown console ("Ordered Products in Quantity") to present week quantities only.
- **Local Sandbox & Mock Logins**: Configured `localhost` environment fallback to protect live production Firestore from manual testing data. Mock admin credentials (`admin@kshetrivafarms.com` / `admin123`) autofill on local launches. Added a quick clear query tool (`?clearLocalLeads=true`) to wipe local storage testing leads.

### 🗓️ July 2, 2026

#### 1. 📊 Styled Weekly Excel Export & Sequential Order IDs (Version 4.7)
- **Historical Price Decoupling**: Order items now capture `pricePerUnit` snapshot at checkout. The statistics breakdown dynamically uses this historical snapshot instead of live catalog prices, preventing active price changes from retrospectively altering older sales metrics.
- **Unified Weekly Price & Cost Editor**: Redesigned the "Product Sales & Profits Breakdown" detailed view to display both selling price and cost price as inline editable fields. Updates are saved strictly for that specific week's orders.
- **Styled Weekly Excel Export Engine**: Added a "Download Excel" action inside each week's details view. Generates a multi-section spreadsheet layout (with empty spacing lines) containing:
  1. **Weekly Financial Overview** (subtotal sales, expenses, discounts, delivery fees, and net profit/loss).
  2. **Product Sales & Profits Breakdown Table**.
  3. **Customer Orders Log Table** (list of all orders in that week with items and totals).
  - Uses an Excel-compatible HTML styling template to support **bold** headers and color highlights natively. Added robust date-parsing safety checks to prevent missing order timestamps from breaking the download flow.
- **Leafy Greens Quantity Mismatch Fix**: Resolved an issue where leafy greens (bunch/katta) ordered under Telugu translations (e.g. `"2 కట్ట"`) resolved incorrectly in dynamic quantity summing. Added Telugu string normalization in `getOptionMultiplier()` and snapshot the multiplier on checkout to future-proof packing logistics.
- **Sequential Lead & Order IDs**: Replaced numeric timestamp-based IDs (`Date.now()`) with continuous formatted sequential IDs (no daily resets):
  - **For Orders**: Formatted as `{padded_sequence}_{DDMMYYYY}` (e.g. `045_02072026`). Sequence count increments continuously across all time (all-time sequence flow).
  - **For Chats/Inquiries**: Formatted as `{DDMMYYYY}_{padded_sequence}` (e.g. `02072026_012`). Sequence count increments continuously across all time.
  - Generates sequence numbers dynamically using a collision-free `Max Sequence + 1` logic, supporting checkouts and backdated manual orders.
- **Customer Leads Section Excel Export**: Replaced the plain CSV customer leads export with a styled Excel HTML spreadsheet (`.xls`), mapping all order and chat IDs (including legacy timestamps) to their respective continuous all-time sequential ID formats and rendering all table headers in bold.
- **Weekly Stats Report (Company Statistics)**: Each weekly Excel report maintains its own week-specific continuous order sequence starting from `001` for the first order of that week.

### 🗓️ July 3, 2026

#### 1. 💬 WhatsApp Redirection & Browser Popup Blocker Fix (Version 4.8)
- **User Gesture Preservation**: Resolved an issue where WhatsApp redirects for checkout orders and general chat inquiries were blocked by browser popup blockers.
- **Synchronous-Asynchronous Bridge**: Implemented a synchronous blank window launch (`window.open('', '_blank')`) immediately inside the user click event handler before the asynchronous sequential ID generation (`await generateLeadId()`) begins.
- **Deferred Redirection & Lifecycle Management**: Updates the opened window's destination asynchronously once the lead ID resolves and the lead is saved to the database. If checkout validation fails or order requirements are unmet, the temporary blank tab is closed programmatically (`waWindow.close()`) to avoid leaving blank pages.

### 🗓️ July 4, 2026

#### 1. 📱 Mobile Direct Deep Linking & Hybrid Redirection (Version 4.8.1)
- **Direct App Redirection on Mobile:** Detected mobile devices using user-agent checks and viewport limits. On mobile devices, WhatsApp checkout and chat links now redirect in the same tab using `window.location.href`. This invokes the OS deep-link handler to open the native WhatsApp application directly without spawning empty browser tabs or redirecting to the WhatsApp Web page.
- **Orphan Tab Prevention:** Disabled the creation of synchronous blank tabs on mobile devices because `window.location.href` modifications are not subject to browser popup blockers. Desktop devices continue using the secure blank tab bypass to keep the store website open in the user's primary tab.

### 🗓️ July 14, 2026

#### 1. 💬 WhatsApp Lead Saving & Callback Integration
- **Database Write Guarantee:** Refactored the lead submission workflow (`saveLeadToDatabase`) to enforce callback validation. The app now successfully registers and completes the Firestore database write callback (or localStorage write queue) before triggering the WhatsApp chat/order redirection.
- **Race Condition Prevention:** Resolves a critical race condition on mobile devices where rapid browser tab redirects or page unloads aborted pending database updates before they could write successfully to the cloud.

#### 2. ⚡ Accessibility & PageSpeed Performance Optimizations
- **WCAG AA Compliance:** Adjusted the color contrast values of footer element links (`#a5d6a7`) and copyright texts (`#ccc`) to meet accessibility color requirements against dark backgrounds.
- **Aria Labeling:** Added explicit `aria-label` tags to interactive drawer toggles, close buttons, and social anchors to improve screen-reader accessibility.
- **Payload Compression:** Replaced legacy `.png` assets in CSS backgrounds (`about_farm_wide.png`) with compressed `.webp` formats (`about_farm_wide.webp`) to optimize rendering speeds.
- **Code Optimization:** Pruned redundant CDNs and script preconnect requests to improve initial PageSpeed index scores.

#### 3. 🛒 Cart Rules, Basket Tiers, and Promotion Coupon Update
- **Volume Basket Tier Re-alignment:** Adjusted the minimum product item counts required to trigger automatic cart volume discount tiers:
  - **Small Basket** (5% off): increased threshold to **6 unique items** (formerly 5).
  - **Medium Basket** (10% off): increased threshold to **10 unique items** (formerly 8).
  - **Large Basket** (15% off): increased threshold to **14 unique items** (formerly 11).
- **Promo Coupon Migration:** Renamed the standard delivery promo coupon from `Delivery30` to `Delivery@30`.
- **Stale Cache Cleanup:** Added a startup script routine that automatically clears legacy `Delivery30` coupon parameters from local storage on bootstrap, preventing users from checking out with expired or incorrect coupon codes.
